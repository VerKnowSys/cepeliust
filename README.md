Point 1:

    * Immutability by default, generic and reusable code - how to stop thinking like CPU (imperatively)
    * No variables (with exception of hybrid languages like: Scala or Rust) - sounds scary, it's not
    * Data structures and data types - idea of cheap abstractions that allow work on "human friendly abstraction and data level"
    * Recurssion and Tail recurssion - No loops (kinda)


Point 2:

    * Pattern matching - how to control the flow efficiently, elegantly and exhaustively


Point 3:

    * Atoms (holds no value, aren't garbage collected, aren't pointers, are shared) - kinda like tags
    * Monads (Option, Result/ Maybe, Either, â€¦) flow control and processing chain - theory looks like "a dragon", but in practice it's natural and rather obvious


Point 4:

    * Function as first class citizen, Function application, lazy evaluation, operator notation, anonymous functions, partial application - a lot of scary words around really simple ideas
    * Syntax sugar - bitter lies
